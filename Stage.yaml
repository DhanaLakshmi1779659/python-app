To achieve this in Azure DevOps (ADO), you can use condition expressions in your pipeline to determine which jobs should run based on the stage variable's value.

Here's an example of how you can configure your pipeline YAML to skip jobs that are less than the stage variable value:

### Example YAML Pipeline

```yaml
trigger:
- main

stages:
- stage: ExampleStage
  displayName: "Example Stage"
  variables:
    stageVariable: 1  # Set your stage variable value here

  jobs:
  - job: Job0
    displayName: "Job 0"
    condition: and(succeeded(), eq(variables['stageVariable'], 0))  # Runs only if stageVariable is 0
    steps:
    - script: echo "Running Job 0"
  
  - job: Job1
    displayName: "Job 1"
    condition: and(succeeded(), eq(variables['stageVariable'], 1))  # Runs only if stageVariable is 1
    steps:
    - script: echo "Running Job 1"

  - job: Job2
    displayName: "Job 2"
    condition: and(succeeded(), ge(variables['stageVariable'], 2))  # Runs if stageVariable is 2 or greater
    steps:
    - script: echo "Running Job 2"

  - job: Job3
    displayName: "Job 3"
    condition: and(succeeded(), ge(variables['stageVariable'], 3))  # Runs if stageVariable is 3 or greater
    steps:
    - script: echo "Running Job 3"
```

### Explanation:

1. **Stage Variable**: The `stageVariable` is set at the stage level. You can adjust this value to control which jobs should run.
  
2. **Condition Expressions**: Each job has a `condition` that checks the value of `stageVariable`:
   - **Job0**: Runs only if `stageVariable` is `0`.
   - **Job1**: Runs only if `stageVariable` is `1`.
   - **Job2**: Runs if `stageVariable` is `2` or greater.
   - **Job3**: Runs if `stageVariable` is `3` or greater.

3. **Skipping Jobs**: By using these conditions, Azure DevOps will skip jobs that do not meet the condition, effectively allowing you to start from the desired job number.

### Customization:

- Change the `stageVariable` to the number corresponding to where you want your jobs to start.
- Adjust the conditions to fit your specific logic and requirements.

This configuration allows you to control job execution based on a dynamic variable, making your pipeline more flexible.
